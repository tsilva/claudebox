# Runs Claude Code with full autonomy inside an isolated container.

# --- Base Image ---
# Debian stable-slim: minimal footprint while providing a full apt ecosystem.

LABEL org.opencontainers.image.title="claude-sandbox" \
      org.opencontainers.image.description="Claude Code in an isolated container"

# --- System Dependencies ---
# Install required packages in a single layer to minimize image size:
#   curl             — download Claude Code binary and version manifest
#   git              — Claude Code uses git for project context and diffs
#   jq               — parse JSON manifests (checksum verification) and project configs
#   netcat-openbsd   — TCP connectivity for desktop notification support (port 19223)
#   python3          — required by many Claude Code tool-use workflows
#   python3-venv     — create isolated Python environments
#   python-is-python3 — symlinks `python` → `python3` for compatibility
# The apt cache is removed after install to keep the layer small.
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \

# --- User Setup + Claude Code + Python Tooling ---
# Create a non-root user "claude". Claude Code refuses to run
# --dangerously-skip-permissions as root, so a regular user is required.
# On macOS/Docker Desktop, UID mapping is handled by the VM layer.
RUN useradd -m -s /bin/bash claude && \
    mkdir -p /opt/claude-code /opt/uv /home/claude/.local/bin && \
    chown -R claude:claude /opt/claude-code /opt/uv /home/claude/.local

# Switch to non-root user for all subsequent commands.
USER claude

# --- Environment Variables ---
# PATH: include Claude Code binary location and user-local bin (uv, symlink).
# NODE_OPTIONS: force IPv4-first DNS resolution to avoid IPv6 routing failures
#   common inside Docker bridge networks.
# NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS: use the system CA certificate bundle instead of
#   Claude Code's bundled certs, which may be incomplete for some environments.
# PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE: skip .pyc file generation (unnecessary in containers).
# PYTHONUNBUFFERED: flush stdout/stderr immediately for real-time log output.
# NOTE: PATH must be set early so uv is available for subsequent RUN commands.

# --- Claude Code Binary ---
# Download the Claude Code standalone binary from Google Cloud Storage.
# The install script handles version detection, architecture mapping,
# binary download, and SHA256 checksum verification.
COPY --chmod=755 --chown=claude:claude scripts/install-claude-code.sh /tmp/install-claude-code.sh
RUN /tmp/install-claude-code.sh && rm /tmp/install-claude-code.sh

# --- uv (Python package installer) ---
# Install uv to /opt/uv/bin so it persists on a read-only rootfs.
# ~/.local is a tmpfs at runtime, so user-local installs would be lost.
ARG UV_VERSION=0.7.12
RUN curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/${UV_VERSION}/install.sh | sh

# --- Common Python Packages ---
# Pre-install pytest for common testing workflows.
# Requires root for system-wide installation; switch back to claude after.
USER root
RUN uv pip install --system --break-system-packages pytest
USER claude

# --- Working Directory ---
# /workspace is the default working directory. At runtime, the host project
# directory is bind-mounted here (or at its real path for path compatibility).
WORKDIR /workspace

# --- Entrypoint ---
# Copy the entrypoint script. The entrypoint handles argument parsing
# (e.g., "shell" for debug access) and launches Claude Code with
# --dangerously-skip-permissions.
COPY --chmod=755 --chown=claude:claude entrypoint.sh /home/claude/entrypoint.sh
