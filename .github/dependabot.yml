# Dependabot Configuration
# =============================================================================
#
# Dependabot is a GitHub built-in bot that automatically checks your project's
# dependencies for newer versions. When it finds one, it opens a pull request
# to update the dependency. This keeps your project secure (patches known
# vulnerabilities) and up to date without manual effort.
#
# This file must live at .github/dependabot.yml for GitHub to detect it.
# Once present, Dependabot runs on GitHub's servers — no CI minutes are used.
#
# Documentation:
# https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates
# =============================================================================

# "version" specifies the Dependabot configuration file format version.
# Version 2 is the current and only supported version. This is required —
# Dependabot will reject the file without it.
version: 2

# "updates" is a list of dependency sources to monitor. Each entry defines
# what type of dependency to watch, where to find it, and how often to check.
# You can have multiple entries (e.g., one for npm, one for Docker, one for
# GitHub Actions), each with its own schedule.
updates:
  # This entry monitors GitHub Actions workflow dependencies — the "uses:"
  # references in .github/workflows/*.yml files (e.g., actions/checkout@v4).
  # When a newer version of an action is released, Dependabot opens a PR
  # to bump the version tag (e.g., @v4 to @v5).
  - package-ecosystem: "github-actions"

    # "directory" tells Dependabot where to look for the dependency files.
    # "/" means the repository root. For GitHub Actions, Dependabot
    # automatically scans .github/workflows/ regardless of this value,
    # but the field is required by the schema.
    directory: "/"

    # "schedule" controls how often Dependabot checks for updates.
    schedule:
      # "interval" can be "daily", "weekly", or "monthly".
      # "weekly" checks once per week (Mondays by default). This is a good
      # balance between staying current and not flooding you with PRs.
      interval: "weekly"
